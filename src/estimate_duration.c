/**
 * @brief Plays moves with some strategy and estimates the probability of reaching each wall height.
 *
 * The number of moves specified are played, in one or several games.
 * During the game(s), we count the number of times each wall height is reached.
 * Then, a fitting is made to estimate the probability of reaching the game over height.
 * The value returned is the estimated mean game duration, i.e. the inverse of this probability.
 * Thus, the game duration can be estimated precisely even if there was no game over during the moves.
 *
 * Note that the estimated duration is lower than the real mean duration when the strategy
 * avoids game over actions or when the strategy gives a special value to the game over states.
 * However, even in such cases, the value returned is a good heuristic to compare different policies.
 *
 * @param game an initialized Game object
 * @param feature_policy the policy to be used
 * @param nb_moves the number of moves to play (if the game is over before the
 * number of moves are played, a new game is played)
 * @param out a file to print the frequencies (then you can gnuplot them), can be NULL
 * @return an estimation of the game duration, i.e. the mean number of moves before the game is over.
